	The `Hmac` class is a utility for creating cryptographic HMAC digests. It can be used in one of two ways:

	* As a stream that is both readable and writable, where data is written to produce a computed HMAC digest on the readable side, or
	* Using the `Hmac.update()` and `Hmac.digest()` methods to produce the computed HMAC digest.

	The `Crypto.createHmac()` method is used to create `Hmac` instances. `Hmac` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.
