/**
	The http2 module provides an implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol.

	The Core API provides a low-level interface designed specifically around support for HTTP/2 protocol features.
	It is specifically not designed for compatibility with the existing HTTP/1 module API.
	However, the Compatibility API is.

	The `http2` Core API is much more symmetric between client and server than the `http` API.
	For instance, most events, like `'error'`, `'connect'` and `'stream'`, can be emitted either by client-side code or server-side code.
